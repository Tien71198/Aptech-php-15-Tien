                <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence
                    and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress." Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh If you have time, you

                <P><b>Short paragraph about environment:</b></P>
                <p>Environment is an essential part of our life. A clean environment is necessary for a peaceful and healthy life. An environment
                    is the natural surroundings which helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally.
                    But nowadays, our environment is disturbing in many different ways. Any type of disturbance in the nature’s balance affects
                    the environment totally. It does not only ruin human lives but also affects on all living beings. We can save our environment
                    with the little step taken by everyone on the earth. We should reduce the amount of waste, throwing wastes properly to
                    its place only…and many other simple ways. It is very important to save environment for human existence. When we protect
                    the environment, we are protecting ourselves and our future as well.</p>

            <P><b>The basic living skills training </b></P>
            <p>German children's ability to live is very strong, which also benefited from the teacher's education direction. In 3 years,
                the kindergarten will put some old old computer machine repair, even let the children contact with children in kindergarten
                play and rest to develop plan plan, teach children how to better organize their own things, dress collocation, also let
                the children practice difficulties to find their own police, firefighters found...... By the time the child was 6 years
                old, they had been a small master of self - care. Kindergarten can not give the children the homework and reading and
                writing tasks The German kindergarten requirements can give children homework and reading and writing tasks, so you are
                in Germany kindergarten not to hear the sound of reading, don't see home after school homework to accompany the mother
                baby in germany. The Germans think early intelligence development will damage the child's enthusiasm for learning, rather
                than a few years later also don't let the children tired of learning life, so even if the interest class, they also began
                to wait for the child after the age of 6.</p></div>
